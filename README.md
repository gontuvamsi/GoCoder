GoCoder - eMarketplace for IT Services
Project Overview
GoCoder is a web-based marketplace that connects customers with IT service providers and individual coders. It allows customers to post projects, receive bids from skilled coders, and award projects based on competency. Coders can explore available projects, submit bids, and work on awarded projects, ensuring a smooth collaboration process. The platform facilitates secure transactions, project tracking, and user management, creating a dynamic and competitive coding marketplace.
Key Features
The customer/vendor module enables users to post projects by defining details such as project name, required technology, and deadlines. Customers can search for coders based on past work and expertise, receive and review bids, award projects to the most suitable coder, and track project history.
The coder module allows coders to manage their profiles, search for available projects using criteria like technology or customer name, bid for projects, and work on assigned tasks. Coders can also mark preferred customers, maintain a record of completed projects, and receive feedback from clients.
The administrator module provides tools for managing users, blocking or deleting customers and coders, and overseeing project listings and activities on the platform.
Tech Stack
The platform is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The backend is built with Java, JDBC, Servlets, and Session Management, while MySQL is used as the database. JavaScript and cookies are implemented for additional functionalities.
How It Works
Customers register on the platform, post projects, and receive bids from interested coders. Coders browse available projects, submit their bids, and work on projects awarded to them. Administrators manage users and oversee platform activities to ensure smooth operations. The system ensures secure transactions and provides a structured approach to project outsourcing in a competitive and transparent environment.
